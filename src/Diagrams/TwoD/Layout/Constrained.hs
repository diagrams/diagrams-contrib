--
-- Lay out diagrams by specifying constraints.  Currently, the API is
-- fairly simple: only equational constraints are supported (not
-- inequalities), and you can only use it to compose a collection of
-- diagrams (and not to, say, compute the position of some point).
-- Future versions may support additional features.
--
-- As a basic example, we can introduce a circle and a square, and
-- constrain them to be next to each other:
--
-- > import Diagrams.TwoD.Layout.Constrained
-- >
-- > constrCircleSq = frame 0.2 $ layout $ do
-- >   c <- newDia (circle 1)
-- >   s <- newDia (square 2)
-- >   constrainWith hcat [c, s]
--
-- We start a block of constraints with 'layout'; introduce new
-- diagrams with 'newDia', and then constrain them, in this case using
-- the 'constrainWith' function.  The result looks like this:
--
-- <<diagrams/src_Diagrams_TwoD_Layout_Constrained_constrCircleSq.svg#diagram=constrCircleSq&width=300>>
--
-- Of course this is no different than just writing @circle 1 |||
-- square 2@. The interest comes when we start constraining things in
-- more interesting ways.
--
-- For example, the following code creates a row of differently-sized
-- circles with a bit of space in between them, and then draws a
-- square which is tangent to the last circle and passes through the
-- center of the third.  Manually computing the size (and position) of
-- this square would be tedious.  Instead, the square is declared to
-- be scalable, meaning it may be uniformly scaled to accomodate
-- constraints.  Then a point on the left side of the square is
-- constrained to be equal to the center of the third circle, and a
-- point on the right side of the square is made equal to a point on
-- the edge of the rightmost circle.  This causes the square to be
-- automatically positioned and scaled appropriately.
--
-- > import Diagrams.TwoD.Layout.Constrained
-- >
-- > circleRow = frame 1 $ layout $ do
-- >   cirs <- newDias (map circle [1..5])
-- >   constrainWith (hsep 1) cirs
-- >   rc <- newPointOn (last cirs) (envelopeP unitX)
-- >
-- >   sq <- newScalableDia (square 1)
-- >   ls <- newPointOn sq (envelopeP unit_X)
-- >   rs <- newPointOn sq (envelopeP unitX)
-- >
-- >   ls =.= centerOf (cirs !! 2)
-- >   rs =.= rc
--
-- <<diagrams/src_Diagrams_TwoD_Layout_Constrained_circleRow.svg#diagram=circleRow&width=300>>
--
-- As a final example, the following code draws a vertical stack of
-- circles, along with an accompanying set of squares, such that (1)
-- each square constrained to lie on the same horizontal line as a
-- circle (using @zipWithM_ 'sameY'@), and (2) the squares all lie on
-- a diagonal line (using 'along').
--
-- > import Diagrams.TwoD.Layout.Constrained
-- > import Control.Monad (zipWithM_)
-- >
-- > diagonalLayout = frame 1 $ layout $ do
-- >   cirs <- newDias (map circle [1..5] # fc blue)
-- >   sqs  <- newDias (replicate 5 (square 2) # fc orange)
-- >   constrainWith vcat cirs
-- >   zipWithM_ sameY cirs sqs
-- >   constrainWith hcat [cirs !! 0, sqs !! 0]
-- >   along (direction (1 ^& (-1))) (map centerOf sqs)
--
-- <<diagrams/src_Diagrams_TwoD_Layout_Constrained_diagonalLayout.svg#diagram=diagonalLayout&width=400>>
--
-- Take a look at the implementations of combinators such as 'sameX',
-- 'allSame', 'constrainDir', and 'along' for ideas on implementing
-- your own constraint combinators.
--
-- Ideas for future versions of this module:
--
-- * Introduce z-index constraints.  Right now the diagrams are just
--   drawn in the order that they are introduced.
--
-- * A way to specify default values --- /i.e./ be able to introduce
--   new point or scalar variables with a specified default value
--   (instead of just defaulting to the origin or to 1).
--
-- * Doing something more reasonable than crashing for overconstrained
--   systems.
--
-- I am also open to other suggestions and/or pull requests!

-- Variables and expressions

-- | An abstract type representing unique IDs for diagrams.  The
--   constructor is not exported, so the only way to obtain a 'DiaID'
--   is by calling 'newDia' or 'newDias'. The phantom type parameter
--   's' ensures that such 'DiaID's can only be used with the
--   constrained system in which they were introduced.

-- | The type of reified expressions over @Vars@, with
--   numeric values taken from the type @n@.  The important point to
--   note is that 'Expr' is an instance of 'Num', 'Fractional', and
--   'Floating', so 'Expr' values can be combined and manipulated as
--   if they were numeric expressions, even when they occur inside
--   other types.  For example, 2D vector values of type @V2 (Expr s
--   n)@ and point values of type @P2 (Expr s n)@ can be combined
--   using operators such as '.+^', '.-.', and so on, in order to
--   express constraints on vectors and points.
--
--   To create literal 'Expr' values, you can use 'mkExpr'.
--   Otherwise, they are introduced by creation functions such as
--   'newPoint', 'newScalar', or diagram accessor functions like
--   'centerOf' or 'xOf'.

--
--   This type is INTERNAL to the library and should not be exported.
--   There is no need to have two separate layers of combining
--   things---combining Constraints and then also combining
--   Constrained systems, both using a monadic interface.  In the
--   user-facing API, we just immediately turn each Constraints value
--   into a Constrained computation, which can then be combined.

-- Constrained points etc.

-- | The point at the center (i.e. local origin) of the given
--   diagram.  For example, to constrain the origin of diagram @b@ to
--   be offset from the origin of diagram @a@ by one unit to the right
--   and one unit up, one may write
--
--   @centerOf b =.= centerOf a .+^ (1 ^& 1)@
centerOf :: Num n => DiaID s -> P2 (Expr s n)
centerOf d = mkDPVar d "center"

-- | The x-coordinate of the center for the given diagram, which can
--   be used in constraints to determine the x-position of this
--   diagram relative to others.
--
--   For example,
--
--   @xOf d1 + 2 === xOf d2@
--
--   constrains diagram @d2@ to lie 2 units to the right of @d1@ in
--   the horizontal direction, though it does not constrain their
--   relative positioning in the vertical direction.
xOf :: Num n => DiaID s -> Expr s n
xOf d = mkDVar d "center" X

-- | The y-coordinate of the center for the given diagram, which can
--   be used in constraints to determine the y-position of this
--   diagram relative to others.
--
--   For example,
--
--   @allSame (map yOf ds)@
--
--   constrains the diagrams @ds@ to all lie on the same horizontal
--   line.
yOf :: Num n => DiaID s -> Expr s n
yOf d = mkDVar d "center" Y

-- | The scaling factor applied to this diagram.
--
--   For example,
--
--   @scaleOf d1 === 2 * scaleOf d2@
--
--   constrains @d1@ to be scaled twice as much as @d2@. (It does not,
--   however, guarantee anything about their actual relative sizes;
--   that depends on their relative size when unscaled.)
scaleOf :: Num n => DiaID s -> Expr s n
scaleOf d = mkDVar d "scale" S

-- | The rotation factor applied to this diagram.
--
--   For example,
--
--   @rotationOf d1 =/\= 2 * rotationOf d2@
--
--   constrains @d1@ to be rotated twice as much as @d2@. (It does not,
--   however, guarantee anything about their actual relative rotation;
--   that depends on their relative rotations when before being transformed.)
rotationOf :: Num n => DiaID s -> Angle (Expr s n)
rotationOf d = pure $ mkDVar d "rotation" R

-- | Create a new (constrainable) point attached to the given diagram,
--   using a function that picks a point given a diagram.
--
--   For example, to get the point on the right edge of a diagram's
--   envelope, one may write
--
--   @rt <- newPointOn d (envelopeP unitX)@
--
--   To get the point (1,1),
--
--   @one_one <- newPointOn d (const (1 ^& 1))@
--
--   This latter example is far from useless: note that @one_one@ now
--   corresponds not to the absolute coordinates (1,1), but to the
--   point which lies at (1,1) /relative to the unscaled diagram's
--   origin/.  If the diagram is positioned or scaled to satisfy some
--   other constraints, @one_one@ will move right along with it.
--
--   For example, the following code establishes a small circle which
--   is located at a specific point relative to a big circle.  The
--   small circle is carried along with the big circle as it is laid
--   out in between some squares.
--
