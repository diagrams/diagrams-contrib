fillDirs implements all of the following rules:

1. [ ] Empty direction @ beginning or end of path -> curl 1.
       Note cyclic paths have no beginning/end; will use cyclic tridiagonal.

2. [ ] Empty direction next to & -> curl 1.

3. [ ] empty P nonempty -> replace empty with nonempty.

4. [ ] nonempty P empty -> replace " " " UNLESS nonempty follows explicit control pts.

       i.e. direction after control pts is always ignored.

5. [ ] .. z .. controls u and ...  -> {u - z} z ... controls if (u /=
       z), or {curl 1} if u = z

       Similarly  controls u and v ... z ... ->  z {z - v} (or curl 1)
